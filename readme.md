# Tetra3D Quickstart

![Screenshot_20220720_083817](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4733521/180024400-d161cc33-e259-4033-a1cc-d24eacd7b4d8.png)

This project serves as a quickstart project for [Tetra3D](https://github.com/SolarLune/tetra3d). The goal is to provide a simple jumping off point for projects utilizing Tetra3D / Ebitengine with Tetra3D.

In this example, the Tetra3D icon spins in the center of the screen. It is shadeless, so you would either need to add a light to the scene, use other shadeless materials, or disable lighting on the scene (`Scene.LightingOn = false`) to be able to see other new objects as they are lit. The faces are colored using vertex coloring.

Note that this quickstart now requires a recent version of Blender (at least 3.6.0).
